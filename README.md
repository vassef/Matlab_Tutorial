# Matlab_Tutorial

I prepared this Tutorial Series during the Signals and Systems winter 1400. At first, you will learn about Variables by exploring some examples, and then you'll be familiarized with the Functions in MATLAB and learn how to write your Functions explicitly. After that, you will practice how to import and export data in MATLAB and work with critical data files like .txt, .csv, etc. You will also learn to implement control statements like If/Switch, For loops, etc. Finally, you'll be able to do some advanced plotting and enhance your plotting's visualization by working with figures, axes, subplots, etc.
